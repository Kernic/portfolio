After the recent climate summit of 2022, I wanted to see if the link between using fossil fuel is really linked with GDP growth. As European countries used coal during the industrial revolution, other developing counties use this fact to justify their actual use of fossil fuel.
Primary :\n - Find if there is a like between GPD growth and CO2 emissions ; \n
At first, let see the data on the ranking of total CO2 emissions by continent and the data for the countries on the G20 (19 counties with the bigest **GDP**, and the European Union {the EU is not in this study becouse 3 country on the G20 are in the EU}).
This data shows that the bigest countries that have emited **CO2** diring history are **nowdays richest countries**. We can also see the ranking between total **CO2 emissions and GDP** are not the same. For exemple **India** is the 7th bigest CO2 emiter but has the 3rd bigest GDP, and **Russia** 3rd bigest CO2 emiter but has the 6th bigest **GDP**. Now let see the impact of total CO2 emissions 
As we can see, GDP growth is not correlated, for the last 100 year, with the total emissions of CO2, but total CO2 emissions are highly correlated with the curent GDP. Bear in mind that correlation doesn't means cosation, but we can make the assumption that C02 emissions helped countries with a heigh GPD (in 2018) during the industrial revolution, but it doesn't help current developing countries. Now let's see what is correlated with the GDP growth on this dataset.
With this data, we can see that the **nothing is correlated with GDP growth** on this dataset, meaning that **greenhouse gaz does not impact GPD growth**, and with that the development of the country. With this data, we can see why developed countries don't whant to transition to **green energies**, and why developing countries don't whant to use **green energies**. It is **very costly** compared to non renuable energies and it does not help on the GDP growth. Using green energies does not impact the **curent GDP growth**, but it can **reduce the wealth reduction** that **global warming** will bring.
