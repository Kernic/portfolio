I am currently **permanently contracted at Headmind Partners**, I have an **engineering degree from ISEN** (Higher Institute of Electronics and Digital or Institut Supérieur de l'Électronique et du Numérique). \nI started my student year at **ISEN** learning about the basis of **engineering**, but also about **biology** as a split learning. Furthermore, I was also introduced to **various programming languages**, which influenced my decision to specialize in **artificial intelligence and data science** for my last years. \nDuring my last year at **ISEN**, I had a **work-study contract with SynerGIE** (Cofidis Group) where I worked with **data scientists** and learned more about **data science**. I worked on several projects that used different technologies, including **web-scraping and CNN** (Convolutional Neural Network). \nAfter this experience, I decided to work at **Headmind Partners** in order to further strengthen my knowledge of **data science**.
